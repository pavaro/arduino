test environement for angry bird project
I have made an little indoor rc plane from depron, called Angry Bird
I want to make flappered wings 
therefore I need to control a servo from a free channel on my emittor (Spektrum DX9)
the servo goes from 0 to 180 degrees angle and back
the servo-speed must be adjustable from 0 (no movement) tot full movement
there is a Arduino program written in Bascom but therefore I need a Bascom programmer
My goal is to write a program in C for the Arduino Uno
In a later stade this Arduino Uno program will be programmed on a Tiny85
